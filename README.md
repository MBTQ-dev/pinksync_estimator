# About this project

This was oen of my first real project. At the time I was a student working in Replit and learning by doing â€” I wasn't yet familiar with many of the tooling and workflows people commonly use today (for example, GitHub Actions, project generators, and CI/CD pipelines). I learned how to look for tools and figure things out as I went, and Replit taught me a lot about rapid iteration, prototyping, and shipping simple apps quickly.

This repository captures that early learning stage: there are experiments, rough edges, and decisions made while I was still discovering better ways to structure and automate development. Over time I learned about more robust workflows (adding automated tests and CI, using generators to scaffold projects, and moving development to a local environment), and those lessons shaped how I work now.
