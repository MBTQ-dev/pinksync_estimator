I'll help you create API endpoints for your small business management system. Based on your requirements, I'll design a comprehensive set of endpoints that cover the entire entrepreneurial journey from idea to execution.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I've created a comprehensive API endpoint structure for your small business management system that covers the entire entrepreneurial journey according to the SBA framework you provided. Let me highlight the key components:

## API Structure Overview

The API is organized into 14 major sections that follow the entrepreneurial journey:

1. **Idea Development Endpoints** - For managing business ideas, vision/mission, and market research
2. **Business Plan Endpoints** - For creating and managing business plans and SBA resources
3. **Business Registration Endpoints** - For legal structure setup, permits, and EIN registration
4. **Funding & Finance Endpoints** - For calculating funding needs and exploring SBA loan options
5. **Branding & Marketing Endpoints** - For brand identity, marketing plans, and online presence
6. **Operations Setup Endpoints** - For operational workflows, supply chain, and customer service
7. **Launch Endpoints** - For launch planning, checklists, and feedback collection
8. **Growth Endpoints** - For scaling strategies, feedback systems, and metrics
9. **Financial Management Endpoints** - For monitoring, tax compliance, and risk management
10. **Exit Strategy Endpoints** - For succession planning and business valuation
11. **Education & Mentorship Endpoints** - For SBA programs and networking opportunities
12. **Document Management Endpoints** - For uploading, retrieving, and managing business documents
13. **Database Variable Management** - For creating and managing system variables
14. **Automated File Management** - For templates and workflow automation

## Key Features

- **Complete Document Management** - Upload, retrieve, update, and delete business documents
- **Database Variable Management** - Create, retrieve, update, and delete key-value pairs
- **Automated File Management** - Create templates, generate files, and set up automated workflows

## Database Schema

The API documentation also includes a comprehensive database schema that supports all these endpoints, including tables for:
- Business profiles
- Business ideas
- Business plans
- Documents
- Database variables
- File templates
- Automated workflows

This API structure provides a solid foundation for building your full business management system. Would you like me to provide more details about any specific section or explain how certain endpoints would work in practice?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
