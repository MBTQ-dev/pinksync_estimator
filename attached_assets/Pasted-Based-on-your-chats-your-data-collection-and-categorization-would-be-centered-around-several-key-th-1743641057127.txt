Summary:

These tags and labels can be used by the AI system to automatically categorize and organize your data based on the content, type, and project context. You don’t need to manually tag everything. Instead, AI will analyze data content, apply appropriate labels, and even update or refine the tags over time as it learns from new data and your feedback.

The key to success in this system will be how accurately the AI can interpret the data based on context (e.g., recognizing that a file is a “business proposal” and tagging it with relevant keywords like client, proposal, and review).

By automating this process, you can achieve seamless data organization and make searching and accessing the right files easier and more efficient.
